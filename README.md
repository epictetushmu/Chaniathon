# ⚡ Chaniathon – Electronics Hackathon @ HMU Chania

## 📍 Overview
Chaniathon is a hackathon hosted at the **Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, HMU Chania**, designed for students to build **smart electronic prototypes** in a short time.

The event is open to **all Greek university students**, and aims to:
- Foster creativity and teamwork.
- Provide hands-on experience in **electronics, IoT, and embedded systems**.
- Act as a **fundraiser for the Epictetus HMU team**.

Teams of **3–5 students** will work together, with each member assigned specific tasks (hardware, coding, documentation, presentation, etc.).

## 🏗️ Structure & Phases

### Phase 1 – Virtual Prototyping
- Tools: **Wokwi** (Arduino/ESP32 simulation).
- Deliverables: working simulation, presentation slides, short video demo.
- All teams participate.

### Phase 2 – Hardware Prototyping (Hands-on)
- Only the **top-scoring teams from Phase 1** advance.
- Teams use HMU labs and provided kits to build physical prototypes.
